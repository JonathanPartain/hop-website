      <description>Announcing the new Hot Hop Hangout (3Hx) sessions A lot has changed at Hop over the past year. We&amp;#8217;ve had the UI rewrite, support for different runtime engines, projects, environments, and finally, as the cherry on the 2020 cake, the ASF incubation.
 As excited about these changes as we are, Hop is a community project above anything else! We&amp;#8217;re introducing this series of Hot Hop Hangouts as a way of knowledge sharing, but most importantly as a way of interacting with the community.</description>
