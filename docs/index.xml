      <title>Apache Hop Architecture</title>

      <description>The Hop architecture is very simple in essence: separate out any metadata from runtime code and tooling.
 Doing this, Hop aims to have a minimal installation footprint and wants to be stateless to facilitate execution on a variety of platforms like Spark and Flink, but also in a variety of scenarios like running in different life cycles such as development, test, acceptance, production, unit testing and continuous integration.
 The way these goals are achieved is by allowing orchestration workloads, defined in the broadest possible sense, to be defined as metadata.</description>

      <description>The Apache Hop team aims to create a new release every 2 to 3 months.
 Here are a few directions that we want to explore for the future of our software:
   Authentication and authorization plugins for various security providers
  VFS:
  Integration with authentication for the VFS plugins, allow VFS configurations per project (instead of the current global Apache Hop configurations)
  S3 compatible object store support through updated AWS libs</description>
