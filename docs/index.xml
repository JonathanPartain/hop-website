      <description>The architecture of Hop is very simple in essence: separate out any metadata from runtime code and tooling.
 Doing this, Hop aims to have a minimal installation footprint and wants to be stateless to facilitate execution on a variety of platforms like Spark and Flink, but also in a variety of scenarios like running in different life cycles such as development, test, acceptance, production, unit testing and continuous integration.</description>

   Set up a software marketplace where 3rd party plugins can be found
  Pluggable field expressions in transforms and actions</description>
