The Apache Hop team aims to create a new release every 2 to 3 months. 

Here are a few directions that we want to explore for the future of our software:

* Authentication and authorization plugins for various security providers
* VFS: 
** Integration with authentication for the VFS plugins, allow VFS configurations per project (instead of the current global Apache Hop configurations)
** S3 compatible object store support through updated AWS libs
* Integrate with graph databases as a plugin type similar to the existing database plugins
* Creation of a 'hop' command with sub-commands
* Set up a software marketplace where 3rd party plugins can be found
* Finish conversion of all plugins to generic XML serialization to allow for JSON/YAML/... metadata serialization of pipelines and workflows
* Pluggable field expressions in transforms and actions
* Integration with Apache Airflow both in Airflow and as a new Workflow engine plugin
* Infrastructure and project environment validation
* MongoDB: API update to support Atlas
* Improved monitoring and logging, integrations with the leading logging and monitoring platforms
* A new docker/k8s pipeline/workflow engine
* ...
