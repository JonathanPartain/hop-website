Apache Hop 2.9.0 comes with a lot of bug fixes, code hardening and a couple of new features. 

== Static Schema 

=== Static Schema Metadata Type
One of the first things new Apache Hop users learn when reading data from files is to use the `Get Fields` button to detect a file's layout. 

Even though this is a straightforward way to get a decent estimate of schemaless input files, sometimes you _know_ what the layout of a file is, and just want to apply a known layout to your file. 

The new https://hop.apache.org/manual/latest/metadata-types/static-schema-definition.html[Static Schema Definition] in Apache Hop 2.9.0 lets you do just that: create a static file definition, and use that definition to specify the layout in your input transforms. 

After a static schema definition has been created in the metadata perspective, it can be used in transforms like the Text File Input, CSV Input, Excel Input and more.

=== Schema Mapping transform

The https://hop.apache.org/manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/schemamapping.html[Static Schema Mapping] transform lets you map your current stream to a Static Schema Definition.

Fields that are available in the Static Schema Definition but not in your input stream are added with empty (null) values.

== CrateDB database dialect and bulk loader

https://cratedb.com[CrateDB] is an enterprise database for time series, documents and vectors, based on PostgreSQL. 

Apache Hop 2.9.0 comes with a new https://hop.apache.org/manual/latest/database/databases/cratedb.html[CrateDB database dialect] and a new https://hop.apache.org/manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/cratedb-bulkloader.html[CrateDB Bulk Loader] transform. 

The bulk loader uses the CrateDB https://cratedb.com/docs/crate/reference/en/latest/interfaces/http.html[HTTP endpoint] or `COPY` command for bulk loading.
