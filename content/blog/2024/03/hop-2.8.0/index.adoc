Apache Hop 2.8.0 comes with a lot of bug fixes, code hardening and a couple of new features. 

== Two new AWS transforms

== Various 

* a nasty bug (https://github.com/apache/hop/issues/3056[#3056]) throwing a NullPointerException in (very exceptional) edge cases when a transform receives more than one input flow was resolved. 

* action duration is now recorded correctly in workflow log (https://github.com/apache/hop/issues/3606[#3606])

* the Execution Information perspective now loads significantly faster for locations with a large number of executions (https://github.com/apache/hop/issues/2845[#2845])

Without community interaction and contribution, Hop is just a coding club! Please feel free to join, participate in the discussion, test, file bug tickets on the software or documentation, ... Contributing is a lot more than writing code.
