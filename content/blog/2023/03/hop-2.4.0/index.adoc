You can now change the default behavior of the environment dropdown box (show all environments) to only show the environments for the selected project. (Configuration perspective -> Plugins -> Projects -> check "Restrict environment list to active project")

== Improvements 

A Lot of bugs have been fixed in among others the https://hop.apache.org//manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/filterrows.html[Filter rows^], https://hop.apache.org//manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/formula.html[Formula^] and https://hop.apache.org//manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/excelinput.html[Microsoft Excel input^] (large file handling) transforms. 

Apache Hop comes with lots of new and improved documentation pages, translation updates and a batch of new samples in the samples project. 

Translations for German, Italian and French have been updated.

== Container image 

The default path for the hop installation inside the container image has been updated from `/opt/hop/hop`
to `/opt/hop`.
Make sure to update your paths if you extended or modified the base image.

Without community interaction and contribution, Hop is just a coding club! Please feel free to join, participate in the discussion, test, file bug tickets on the software or documentation, ... Contributing is a lot more than writing code.
