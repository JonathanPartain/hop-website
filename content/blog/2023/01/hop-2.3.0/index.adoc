Apache Hop 2.3.0 is mostly a bug fixing release with only a limited number of new features.

== Weblate - New Translation tool

With the switch to https://weblate.org/en/[Weblate^], it is now a lot easier to contribute translations to Apache Hop.

All it takes is heading over to https://translate.project-hop.org[], creating an account and start translating Apache Hop in your native language. 

Please create a https://github.com/apache/hop/issues[ticket^] if you want to translate Apache Hop into a language that is not yet available.

== Documentation updates 

Creating and updating documentation is a never-ending task. 

There have been some layout changes: 

* commands now live in tabs for Windows an Linux/Mac
* large tables, code blocks etc can now be expanded or collapsed.

A lot of pages were added and updated, some notable changes are: 

* improved https://hop.apache.org/manual/next/pipeline/metadata-injection.html[Metadata Injection] pages and samples 
* improved https://hop.apache.org/manual/next/metadata-types/pipeline-probe.html[Pipeline Probe] docs and samples
* a new https://hop.apache.org/manual/next/community-blogs/index.html[list of community posts and articles] was added.

== Vertica Bulk Loader 

The https://www.vertica.com[Vertica] https://hop.apache.org/manual/next/pipeline/transforms/verticabulkloader.html[Bulk Loader] was already available as an external plugin, but has now been integrated into the main code base.

This bulk loader drastically improves the data loading speed to the Vertica analytical database.

Without community interaction and contribution, Hop is just a coding club! Please feel free to join, participate in the discussion, test, file bug tickets on the software or documentation, ... Contributing is a lot more than writing code.

Check out our link:/community/contributing/[contribution guides^] and http://hop.apache.org/community/ethos/[Code of Conduct^] to find out more.
