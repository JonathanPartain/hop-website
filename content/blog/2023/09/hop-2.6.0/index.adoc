After a number of mostly bug fixing releases, Apache Hop 2.6.0 comes with a couple of new features.

== Apache Beam Upgrade and doc updates

The https://hop.apache.org//manual/latest/pipeline/beam/running-the-beam-samples.html[Running the Beam samples] docs section now also contains a https://hop.apache.org//manual/latest/pipeline/beam/beam-samples-dataflow.html[guide^] to run the Apache Hop samples on Google Cloud Dataflow. 

== New Google Transforms 

=== Google Analytics 4 

Since Google switched to Google Universal Analytics off on July 1st, all Google Analytics traffic now flows through GA4 properties. 

This new https://hop.apache.org//manual/latest/pipeline/transforms/google-analytics.html[Google Analytics 4^] Input transform collects data from a Google Analytics dimensions and metrics into your pipelines.

Originally contributed by https://github.com/jfmonteil/[
Jeff Monteil], these plugins have now been integrated in the main Apache Hop code base, and have been updated to work with the latest Apache Hop api and the latest Google Sheets and Google Drive apis.
