      <description>Apache Hop - Incubation Proposal Accepted From the very start with Hop, we haven&amp;#8217;t exactly been secretive about our intention to join the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and donate Project Hop to the ASF as Apache Hop.
 After almost a year of work on Project Hop, we&amp;#8217;re very happy to announce we&amp;#8217;ve reached a first milestone: the Apache Hop proposal was submitted to the incubator mailing list on September, 9th and has been accepted!</description>
