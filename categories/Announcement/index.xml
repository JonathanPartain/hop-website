      <description>The Hop community is pleased to announce the availability of the Apache Hop (Incubating) 0.70 release.
 This release contains about 2.5 months of work. Since our 0.60 release in late January, we&amp;#8217;ve seen a lot of activity in a variety of areas. Hop contributors not only worked on code: we&amp;#8217;ve received contributions in artwork, translations, documentation etc. We have more than 45 new plugins, and a total of 223 jira tickets were implemented.</description>
