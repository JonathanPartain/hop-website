      <description>With 2020 coming to a close, we&amp;#8217;ve started preparing for 0.50, which will be our first Apache release. We&amp;#8217;ll have more news on that soon!
 At the start of the final month of 2020, let&amp;#8217;s have a closer look at what happened at Apache Hop in November.
   Apache Hop Incubation - infrastructure Our migration to the Apache Software Foundation infrastructure is now done. All references to Project Hop have been changed to Apache Hop (Incubating).</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve had another couple of busy months at Apache Hop. A lot of these changes have been happening in the background, but are very exciting nevertheless. As we&amp;#8217;re getting close to finalizing the background work, we&amp;#8217;ll soon have more time to work on Hop platform features again.
 Here&amp;#8217;s what happened over the last two months.

      <description>Apache Hop - Incubation Proposal Accepted From the very start with Hop, we haven&amp;#8217;t exactly been secretive about our intention to join the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and donate Project Hop to the ASF as Apache Hop.
 After almost a year of work on Project Hop, we&amp;#8217;re very happy to announce we&amp;#8217;ve reached a first milestone: the Apache Hop proposal was submitted to the incubator mailing list on September, 9th and has been accepted!</description>

      <description>We released 0.30 in late July, followed by a couple of weeks of slower progress because of summer holidays, but here we are with a roundup for July and August.
 After all the heavy lifting we did in the first half of the year, Project Hop now entered a feature-freeze phase. The focus now is on bug fixing, documentation and hardening the platform. Minor new features may continue to appear, just don&amp;#8217;t expect any spectacular new functionality for now.</description>

      <description>Currently we are working on creating a first public preview version of the Hop Orchestration Platform. Expect this version to give you a first overview of what the future of Hop will be offering, we are not following a specific roadmap and are working on all fronts. The main focus of the preview version is UI changes.
 Following items contain the biggest changes but much more is happening.
   UI We are completely rewriting the Hop UI, creating a new experience on how to create data pipelines.</description>

      <description>The architecture of Hop is very simple in essence: separate out any metadata from runtime code and tooling.
 Doing this, Hop aims to have a minimal installation footprint and wants to be stateless to facilitate execution on a variety of platforms like Spark and Flink, but also in a variety of scenarios like running in different life cycles such as development, test, acceptance, production, unit testing and continuous integration.</description>

The other list, Hop Developer List, is for the Hop team to discus development of the actual Hop project; do not use this list for question on using Hop.

      <description>Is this a fork?
  Yes this is a fork, in the sense that we used Kettle 8.2.0.7 as a starting point for Apache Hop. Apache Hop wants to used that as a starting point to explore the future of data integration. Check out the Roadmap and Architecture sections.
     Is this a hostile fork?
  By all means no! Kettle will remain a stable and trustworthy platform for data integration.</description>

      <description>On a very high level here are the things we want to do:
   Change all package names to org.apache.hop from org.pentaho.di (done)
  Remove all existing external dependencies to non-standard libraries so Hop can be compiled without referencing a proprietary Maven server. (done)
  Remove all references to the deprecated XUL libraries and build a new UI plugin system. Port existing GUI code over to it.</description>
