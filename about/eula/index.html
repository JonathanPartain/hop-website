License Agreement </h1> <aside class="toc embedded"> <div class="toc-menu"> <h3>Contents</h3> </div> </aside> <div class="paragraph"> <p>This End User License Agreement (this "<strong>Agreement</strong>") is made between Lean Solution ("<strong>Lean</strong>") and the end-user of Lean’s software ("<strong>Licensee</strong>").<br> Licensee intends to use certain Lean products (each, a <strong>"Product"</strong>) and to obtain a subscription license through one of Lean’s third party resellers or integrators (the <strong>"Lean Partner"</strong>). Licensee will enter a written agreement with the Lean Partner that covers fees, payment provisions and certain license and support terms (the <strong>"Customer Agreement"</strong>). This Agreement provides additional license terms in connection with the use of the Products by Licensee and must be accepted by Licensee at the time Licensee enters into the applicable Customer Agreement. The effective date of this Agreement (the <strong>"Effective Date"</strong>) is the same date as the effective date of the Customer Agreement.<br> In consideration of the foregoing, Lean and Licensee agree as follows:</p> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="_license_terms">LICENSE TERMS.</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p><strong>1.1 Additional Terms.</strong> Licensee hereby agrees to the terms of this Agreement and the Customer Agreement. In the event of any conflicts between this Agreement and the Customer Agreement, this Agreement will control. Licensee’s right to use the Products is and will be limited to the subscription period (<strong>"Subscription Period"</strong>) and number of Cores (defined in Section 1.2 below) specified in the Customer Agreement. If there is no Subscription Period specified in the Customer Agreement, the Subscription Period will be deemed to be one year from the effective date of the Customer Agreement.<br> <strong>1.2 License.</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Customer Agreement, Lean hereby grants to Licensee, during the Subscription Period, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable right and license: (a) to install the object code version of the applicable Product(s) on the number of Cores specified in the Customer Agreement; and (b) to use the applicable Product(s) solely for Licensee’s internal business operations (understanding that Licensee may provide the output generated by the Products, including reports, dashboards, data analysis and data mining to third parties as Licensee determines). If Customer purchases "development/testing" licenses, Customer acknowledges that such licenses are intended for use in Customer&#8217;s development and testing environments only, and not in a production environment. Licensee may make up to two copies of the Products for backup and/or archival purposes. <strong>"Core"</strong> means an individual processor and associated cache memory that is capable of executing a single Product code thread at a time.<br> <strong>1.3 License Key.</strong> Licensee acknowledges that the initial license key (<strong>"Initial License Key"</strong>) provided to Licensee will enable use of the applicable Product(s) for sixty days. The Product will cease operation at the end of the sixty day period, unless Licensee has paid the Lean Partner as required under the Customer Agreement. Lean will provide a license key for the full Subscription Period only upon full payment of all amounts due to the applicable Lean Partner. Licensee further acknowledges that Lean may choose not to renew any license key with Licensee if Lean reasonably believes that Licensee is in violation of the terms of this Agreement.<br> <strong>1.4 Support Services.</strong> Licensee acknowledges that the Lean Partner is fully responsible for the performance of any and all support services to be provided to Licensee with respect to the Products. Lean has no support or similar obligations to Licensee with respect to the Products unless and until Lean and Licensee enter into a separate written agreement concerning such services.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="sect1"> <h2 id="_intellectual_property">INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.</h2> <div class="sectionbody"> <div class="paragraph"> <p><strong>2.1 License Restrictions.</strong> The license set forth in Section 1.2 (License) above is not a perpetual license, and Licensee has no right to retain or to use the Product after termination of the applicable Subscription Period for any reason. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement and as may be required by applicable law, Licensee has no right to copy, modify or create derivative works of any of the Products. Licensee has no right to rent, lease, sublicense or otherwise distribute or make the Products available to any third party. Licensee has no right to use the Products in the performance of services for or on behalf of any third party or as a service bureau. Except as may be required by applicable law, Licensee may not disassemble, decompile or otherwise reverse engineer the Product nor permit any third party to do so. Lean reserves all rights not expressly granted to Licensee under this Agreement. The use of Lean’s intellectual property beyond the scope of the license expressly granted is outside the subject matter of this Agreement.<br> <strong>2.2 Audit Rights.</strong> Licensee will maintain accurate records as to its use of the Products as authorized by this Agreement, for a period of at least two years from the last day of the Subscription Period. Lean may, upon ten days prior notice and during Licensee’s normal business hours, audit such records to verify that Licensee has used the Products in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Customer Agreement, provided that Lean may conduct no more than one audit in any twelve month period. Lean will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the disruption of Licensee’s normal business activities in connection with any such audit. Lean will not disclose any information learned in the course of its audit to any third party, except to exercise its rights under this Agreement. Licensee will promptly pay Lean or the applicable Lean Partner any underpayments revealed by any such audit.<br> <strong>2.3 Open Source Software.</strong> Any open source software included in the Products, along with the applicable license, is listed in the Product license file or documentation.

In addition, Lean will pay all of those fees and costs, including attorney’s fees, resulting from such Claim, as well as all damages awarded against Customer, or any amounts agreed to by Lean in a monetary settlement, in connection with such Claim. Lean may, at its expense, attempt to resolve the Claim by: (a) modifying the Product to avoid the alleged infringement; (b) obtaining a license to permit Customer’s use of the Product as contemplated by this Agreement; or (c) terminating the license grant set forth in this Agreement with respect to the Product and giving Customer a refund attributable to the remainder of the then-effective Subscription Period.
